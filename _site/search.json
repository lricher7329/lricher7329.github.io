    "text": "Welcome to Clinical Teaching in Pediatric Neurology\nThis website is dedicated to enhancing clinical and bedside teaching in pediatric neurology through practical, case-based learning. Designed for healthcare professionals, students, and educators alike, this resource offers a comprehensive collection of clinical cases that cover a wide range of pediatric neurological conditions. Each case is carefully curated to foster a hands-on learning approach, emphasizing the real-world application of knowledge in patient care.\nWhether you’re a trainee looking to deepen your understanding or an experienced clinician seeking to refine your teaching methods, “Clinical Teaching in Pediatric Neurology” serves as a valuable tool. Through detailed case presentations, discussion points, and teaching tips, we aim to promote a dynamic learning environment that bridges theory with clinical practice, helping to develop the next generation of skilled pediatric neurologists."

    "text": "Slide 1: Case Presentation Overview\nPatient Information\n- Name: Sam, a 2-year-old boy\n- Presenting Complaint: Delayed developmental milestones and episodes of unsteadiness\n\n\n\nSlide 2: History\nSam was born full-term after an uneventful pregnancy and birth. Development initially normal but delays were noticed around 9 months: - Not achieved independent sitting by 12 months - No walking yet - Unsteady episodes and occasional falls\nAdditional symptoms: - Vomiting episodes without clear cause - Irritability and decreased appetite\nFamily history: No known neurological disorders, though a maternal uncle reportedly died young from an unknown illness.\n\n\n\nSlide 3: Physical Examination\n\nGeneral: Small for age, mild pallor.\nNeurological Examination:\n\nCranial Nerves: Bilateral nystagmus on lateral gaze; mild ptosis on the right side.\nMotor: Hypotonia in extremities; decreased reflexes.\nCoordination: Ataxia with reaching.\nDevelopmental Milestones: Delayed across all domains.\n\n\n\n\n\nSlide 4: Initial Diagnostic Workup\n\nMRI Brain:\n\nSymmetric hyperintense lesions in the basal ganglia and brainstem, with particular involvement of the putamen on T2-weighted images.\n\nBlood Lactate: Elevated (suggesting a metabolic disorder).\nGenetic Testing: Mitochondrial DNA mutation associated with Leigh syndrome.\n\n\n\n\nSlide 5: Instructional Questions\nQuestion 1:\nWhat clinical features suggest a mitochondrial disorder like Leigh’s disease?\nAnswer:\nSam’s developmental delay, unsteadiness, ataxia, nystagmus, and vomiting are signs of neurodegeneration, consistent with Leigh’s disease.\n\n\n\nSlide 6: Instructional Questions (continued)\nQuestion 2:\nWhy is MRI imaging helpful in diagnosing Leigh’s disease?\nAnswer:\nMRI reveals characteristic symmetric lesions in the basal ganglia and brainstem, typical in Leigh’s disease due to mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\n\n\nSlide 7: Instructional Questions (continued)\nQuestion 3:\nWhat is the significance of elevated lactate in Leigh’s disease?\nAnswer:\nElevated lactate suggests mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to anaerobic metabolism and supporting a mitochondrial disease diagnosis.\n\n\n\nSlide 8: Instructional Questions (continued)\nQuestion 4:\nHow does genetic testing aid in diagnosing Leigh’s disease?\nAnswer:\nGenetic testing identifies mitochondrial DNA mutations confirming Leigh’s disease, offering diagnostic clarity and insights on prognosis.\n\n\n\nSlide 9: Instructional Questions (continued)\nQuestion 5:\nWhat management strategies are available for Leigh’s disease?\nAnswer:\nWhile there’s no cure, management includes supportive care, physical therapy, and sometimes supplements like coenzyme Q10 and thiamine.\n\n\n\nSlide 10: Conclusion\nLeigh’s disease diagnosis requires a multi-modal approach: - Neuroimaging, biochemical markers, and genetic analysis are critical. - Management is supportive, focusing on symptom relief and quality of life improvement."

    "text": "Why Case-Based Learning?\nCase-based learning has proven to be an effective method for building clinical skills. By working through real or realistic patient scenarios, learners are encouraged to integrate knowledge from multiple domains, apply it in practical ways, and engage in clinical reasoning. Each case on this site provides opportunities to think critically, ask meaningful questions, and simulate decision-making in a safe, supportive environment."
