    "text": "Clinical Trials Acceleration\nClinical trials acceleration is a core pillar of my work. I lead two complementary organizations that together form the operational backbone of clinical trials in northern Alberta, and I am driving a strategic initiative to connect them into a provincial engine.\n\nUACT — University of Alberta Clinical Trials\nUniversity of Alberta Clinical Trials (UACT) coordinates the university’s clinical research ecosystem. UACT provides the institutional framework for conducting trials across all ages and therapeutic areas — from pharmaceuticals and digital devices to exercise interventions and continuing care. The Clinical Trials Office (CTO) serves as its operational secretariat.\nKey UACT capabilities include:\n\nState-of-the-art clinical trial facilities and specialized personnel\nAdvanced electronic data capture and trial management systems\nInvestigator-initiated trial development support for national grant competitions\nThe Indigenous Clinical Trials Unit (ICTU) — the first of its kind in Canada, empowering Indigenous-led clinical research\n\n\n\nNACTRC — Northern Alberta Clinical Trials and Research Centre\nI serve as Center Director of NACTRC, a joint venture between the University of Alberta and Alberta Health Services established in 1999. NACTRC provides clinical research administration, operations, and support across the Edmonton Zone.\nNACTRC’s mandate:\n\nDevelop a comprehensive clinical research administration and support framework for the University of Alberta and AHS Edmonton Zone\nImplement systems to improve the quality, quantity, and efficiency of clinical research\nExpand clinical research support capacity and streamline study startup\nServe sponsors and investigators across industry and investigator-initiated trials\n\nTogether, UACT and NACTRC form an integrated ecosystem: UACT provides institutional strategy and coordination, while NACTRC delivers operational infrastructure and site-level support.\n\n\nThe Refocus Initiative\nRefocus Clinical Trials is the parent strategic initiative driving clinical trials acceleration across Alberta. It connects infrastructure investment, technology platforms, national partnerships, and methodology expertise into a single coherent vision.\nRefocus encompasses several interconnected projects:\n\nCFI-CTAP — the primary infrastructure grant vehicle\nAlberta FAST — the provincial acceleration framework\nMetricis — the analytics platform providing real-time trial metrics\nMethodology programs — enrichment designs, adaptive trials, AI-enhanced data strategies\n\n\n\nCFI-CTAP\nThe Clinical Trials Acceleration Platform (CFI-CTAP) is a major Canada Foundation for Innovation infrastructure grant application designed to build the physical and digital infrastructure needed to run clinical trials faster, more efficiently, and at greater scale across Alberta.\nCFI-CTAP supports:\n\nShared clinical trial infrastructure across Edmonton and Calgary\nTechnology platforms for trial operations (Catalyst, Metricis)\nData integration and analytics capabilities\nTraining and capacity-building for clinical trial personnel\n\n\n\nAlberta FAST\nAlberta FAST (Facilitated Access to Studies and Trials) is a sub-initiative within Refocus aimed at streamlining the pathway from trial concept to patient enrollment. Alberta FAST addresses the operational bottlenecks — contract negotiation, ethics review timelines, site activation — that slow trial startup."
