## Lawrence Richer, MD, FRCPC

I am a pediatric neurologist, clinician-scientist, Associate Dean (Research) in the College of Health Sciences, and Center Director of the Northern Alberta Clinical Trials and Research Centre (NACTRC) at the University of Alberta. My work sits at the intersection of clinical medicine, research strategy, and systems design — building infrastructure that helps researchers and clinicians translate discoveries into better patient outcomes.

### Institutional Leadership

As Associate Dean (Research), I oversee research strategy, funding development, and infrastructure across the College of Health Sciences. This includes:

- **Clinical Research Institute (CRI)** — strategic direction and operational oversight for institutional clinical research
- **AI + Health Hub** — co-leading the University's initiative to embed artificial intelligence in health research
- **Kipnes Research Institute** — contributing to the launch and strategic planning of this new research institute
- **Research Hubs** — oversight of the Regenerative Medicine Hub, Healthy Aging Hub, and Collective Health Research Hub

### Committee Service

I serve on numerous institutional, provincial, and national committees that shape research policy and infrastructure:

**National**

- NACTRC (Northern Alberta Clinical Trials and Research Centre) — Center Director
- CANTRAIN — Canadian clinical trials training network
- CIHR College of Reviewers — peer review for clinical trial grants
- ACRC Executive Committee — Alberta Clinical Research Consortium

**Institutional**

- Council of Associate Deans Research (CADR)
- University Research Advisory Committee (URAC)
- University Research Infrastructure Advisory Committee (URIAC)
- Centers and Institutes Committee
- Research Technology Steering Committee (RTSC)
- Future Impact Council of the Stollery (FICS)
- Kaye Fund Steering Committee
- IPG Infrastructure Working Group
- Strategic Research Investment Program (SRIP)
- Clinical Trials Advisory Committee (CTAC)
- Digital Health Working Group
- Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)

### Clinical Practice

I maintain an active clinical practice in pediatric neurology at the Stollery Children's Hospital, with subspecialty expertise in:

- **Autonomic disorders** — including POTS, autonomic neuropathies, and dysautonomia
- **Headache medicine** — pediatric and adolescent migraine, chronic daily headache
- **Rare neurological diseases** — metabolic and genetic conditions affecting the nervous system

I also provide medico-legal expert opinions for the Canadian Medical Protective Association (CMPA) in pediatric neurology.

### Teaching & Mentorship

Teaching is central to my academic identity. I contribute through:

- Hybrid Pediatric Neurology Case Rounds
- Neuroscience Grand Rounds
- Neuro 210 — medical school neuroscience teaching
- Clinical Trials Workshop — methodology education for trainees and faculty
- Direct supervision of graduate students and research trainees ([see Team](team.qmd))
