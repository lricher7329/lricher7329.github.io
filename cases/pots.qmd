# Illustrative Questions and Answers

### Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
- **Answer:** Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), characterized by a heart rate increase upon standing without significant hypotension, often with symptoms like dizziness, fatigue, and palpitations.

### Question 2: What diagnostic criteria define POTS?
- **Answer:** 
  - Heart rate increase of ≥30 bpm (or ≥40 bpm in adolescents) within 10 minutes of standing or head-up tilt, without significant hypotension.
  - Symptoms lasting ≥6 months.
  - Exclusion of other causes.

### Question 3: What initial diagnostic tests should be considered?
- **Answer:**
  - **Orthostatic Vital Signs**
  - **Head-Up Tilt Test (HUTT)**
  - **Blood Tests** (to rule out secondary causes).
  - **ECG** (to rule out arrhythmias or structural abnormalities).

### Question 4: How does the Head-Up Tilt Test (HUTT) support the diagnosis of POTS?
- **Answer:** In POTS, HUTT typically shows a marked HR increase without BP drop when tilted to 60–70 degrees, confirming orthostatic intolerance.

### Question 5: What are common comorbid conditions associated with POTS?
- **Answer:** Anxiety, migraines, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and chronic fatigue syndrome.

### Question 6: What are key components of non-pharmacologic management for POTS?
- **Answer:**
  - **Increased fluid intake** (2–3 liters/day) and **salt supplementation.**
  - **Physical reconditioning,** especially lower body strength.
  - **Compression garments.**
  - **Frequent small meals** to prevent postprandial symptoms.
  - **Sleep hygiene** and **stress management.**

### Question 7: When would pharmacologic management be considered, and what options are available?
- **Answer:** For significant symptoms despite lifestyle changes. Options include:
  - **Beta-blockers** (e.g., propranolol).
  - **Midodrine** for vasoconstriction.
  - **Fludrocortisone** for volume expansion.
  - **SSRIs** or **SNRIs** for anxiety or dysautonomia.

### Question 8: What is the prognosis for adolescents with POTS?
- **Answer:** Many improve with time, especially with non-pharmacologic interventions, though some have chronic symptoms.

# Summary Points for Teaching

- POTS is a form of orthostatic intolerance with a hallmark HR increase upon standing.
- More common in adolescents, particularly females.
- Management emphasizes hydration, salt intake, and physical reconditioning, with medications as adjuncts.
- Educate patients to avoid prolonged standing and rapid positional changes.
