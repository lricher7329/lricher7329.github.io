- Increased dizziness and palpitations in the morning.
- Fatigue most days, affecting focus in school.
- Near-syncope episodes without loss of consciousness.
- Episodes last from seconds to minutes, relieved by lying down.

- History of anxiety, no other significant medical conditions.
- No syncope, seizure, or head trauma.

# Family History
- Mother has migraines; sibling with anxiety.

# Social History

---

# Review of Systems
- Denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or visual changes.
- Reports occasional abdominal discomfort and constipation.

---

# Physical Examination

## Vital Signs
- **Supine Vital Signs:** HR 78 bpm, BP 110/70 mmHg
- **Standing (after 10 min):** HR 130 bpm, BP 108/68 mmHg
  - Heart rate increase > 40 bpm from supine to standing.

## Physical Findings
- Normal cardiac and respiratory exam.
- Neurological exam is normal.
- Skin: mildly cool extremities, no rash.

# Illustrative Questions and Answers

## Question 1: Most Likely Diagnosis?
- **Answer:** Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)
  - Characterized by heart rate increase upon standing without significant hypotension.
  - Common symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, and palpitations.

---

## Question 2: Diagnostic Criteria for POTS
- **Heart rate increase:** ≥30 bpm (or ≥40 bpm in adolescents) within 10 minutes of standing.
- **Symptoms:** Lasting ≥6 months.
- **Exclusion of other causes:** Rule out dehydration, medications, etc.

---

## Question 3: Initial Diagnostic Tests
- **Orthostatic Vital Signs**
- **Head-Up Tilt Test (HUTT)**
- **Blood Tests:** Rule out anemia, electrolyte imbalances, thyroid dysfunction.
- **ECG:** Rule out arrhythmias or structural abnormalities.

---

## Question 4: Role of Head-Up Tilt Test (HUTT)
- **Answer:** Confirms diagnosis by showing HR increase without BP drop when tilted to 60–70 degrees.

---

## Question 5: Common Comorbid Conditions with POTS
- Anxiety, migraines, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic fatigue syndrome.
- Recognizing comorbidities aids holistic management.

---

## Question 6: Non-Pharmacologic Management
- **Hydration and salt:** 2–3 liters of fluid and salt supplementation.
- **Physical reconditioning:** Lower body strengthening exercises.
- **Compression garments:** Supports venous return.
- **Small, frequent meals:** Prevents postprandial symptoms.
- **Sleep hygiene and stress management.**

---

## Question 7: Pharmacologic Management
- Consider if significant symptoms persist.
- **Beta-blockers** (e.g., propranolol) for tachycardia.
- **Midodrine** for vasoconstriction support.
- **Fludrocortisone** for volume expansion.
- **SSRIs/SNRIs** for anxiety or dysautonomia symptoms.

## Question 8: Prognosis for Adolescents with POTS
- Many improve with non-pharmacologic interventions.
- Some experience symptom reduction or resolution by adulthood.

# Summary Points for Teaching

- POTS is a form of orthostatic intolerance with a hallmark HR increase upon standing.
- More common in adolescents, particularly females.
- Emphasis on hydration, salt intake, physical reconditioning, and adjunct medications if needed.
- Educate on avoiding prolonged standing and rapid positional changes.
