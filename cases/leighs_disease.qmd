# Slide 1: Case Presentation Overview

**Patient Information**\
- **Name:** Sam, a 2-year-old boy\
- **Presenting Complaint:** Delayed developmental milestones and episodes of unsteadiness

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Slide 2: History

Sam was born full-term after an uneventful pregnancy and birth. Development initially normal but delays were noticed around 9 months: - Not achieved independent sitting by 12 months - No walking yet - Unsteady episodes and occasional falls

Additional symptoms: - Vomiting episodes without clear cause - Irritability and decreased appetite

Family history: No known neurological disorders, though a maternal uncle reportedly died young from an unknown illness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Slide 3: Physical Examination

-   **General:** Small for age, mild pallor.
-   **Neurological Examination:**
    -   **Cranial Nerves:** Bilateral nystagmus on lateral gaze; mild ptosis on the right side.
    -   **Motor:** Hypotonia in extremities; decreased reflexes.
    -   **Coordination:** Ataxia with reaching.
    -   **Developmental Milestones:** Delayed across all domains.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Slide 4: Initial Diagnostic Workup

1.  **MRI Brain:**
    -   Symmetric hyperintense lesions in the basal ganglia and brainstem, with particular involvement of the putamen on T2-weighted images.
2.  **Blood Lactate:** Elevated (suggesting a metabolic disorder).
3.  **Genetic Testing:** Mitochondrial DNA mutation associated with Leigh syndrome.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Slide 5: Instructional Questions

**Question 1:**\
What clinical features suggest a mitochondrial disorder like Leigh’s disease?

**Answer:**\
Sam's developmental delay, unsteadiness, ataxia, nystagmus, and vomiting are signs of neurodegeneration, consistent with Leigh’s disease.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Slide 6: Instructional Questions (continued)

**Question 2:**\
Why is MRI imaging helpful in diagnosing Leigh’s disease?

**Answer:**\
MRI reveals characteristic symmetric lesions in the basal ganglia and brainstem, typical in Leigh’s disease due to mitochondrial dysfunction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Slide 7: Instructional Questions (continued)

**Question 3:**\
What is the significance of elevated lactate in Leigh’s disease?

**Answer:**\
Elevated lactate suggests mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to anaerobic metabolism and supporting a mitochondrial disease diagnosis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Slide 8: Instructional Questions (continued)

**Question 4:**\
How does genetic testing aid in diagnosing Leigh’s disease?

**Answer:**\
Genetic testing identifies mitochondrial DNA mutations confirming Leigh’s disease, offering diagnostic clarity and insights on prognosis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Slide 9: Instructional Questions (continued)

**Question 5:**\
What management strategies are available for Leigh’s disease?

**Answer:**\
While there’s no cure, management includes supportive care, physical therapy, and sometimes supplements like coenzyme Q10 and thiamine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Slide 10: Conclusion

Leigh’s disease diagnosis requires a multi-modal approach: - Neuroimaging, biochemical markers, and genetic analysis are critical. - Management is supportive, focusing on symptom relief and quality of life improvement.
