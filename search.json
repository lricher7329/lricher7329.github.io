    "text": "How web pages can support clinical teaching?\nUsing web pages and PowerPoint slides as teaching tools can significantly enhance clinical education by providing both flexibility and depth in content delivery. Web pages serve as a versatile, accessible platform where learners can explore case studies, review key concepts, and engage with supplementary materials at their own pace. They can be continuously updated to include recent advances in the field and customized with multimedia resources, such as videos, interactive quizzes, and external links, making learning more engaging and dynamic. PowerPoint slides, on the other hand, are valuable in structured teaching sessions, offering a clear, visual format that guides learners through complex information in a logical, digestible sequence. When used together, web pages offer a comprehensive, self-paced learning resource, while PowerPoint slides support focused, interactive discussions, making these tools complementary assets in clinical teaching."

Development initially normal but delays were noticed around 9 months: - Not achieved independent sitting by 12 months - No walking yet - Unsteady episodes and occasional falls\nAdditional symptoms: - Vomiting episodes without clear cause - Irritability and decreased appetite\nFamily history: No known neurological disorders, though a maternal uncle reportedly died young from an unknown illness.\n\n\n\nSlide 3: Physical Examination\n\nGeneral: Small for age, mild pallor.\nNeurological Examination:\n\nCranial Nerves: Bilateral nystagmus on lateral gaze; mild ptosis on the right side.\nMotor: Hypotonia in extremities; decreased reflexes.\nCoordination: Ataxia with reaching.\nDevelopmental Milestones: Delayed across all domains.\n\n\n\n\n\nSlide 4: Initial Diagnostic Workup\n\nMRI Brain:\n\nSymmetric hyperintense lesions in the basal ganglia and brainstem, with particular involvement of the putamen on T2-weighted images.\n\nBlood Lactate: Elevated (suggesting a metabolic disorder).\nGenetic Testing: Mitochondrial DNA mutation associated with Leigh syndrome.\n\n\n\n\nSlide 5: Instructional Questions\nQuestion 1:\nWhat clinical features suggest a mitochondrial disorder like Leigh’s disease?\nAnswer:\nSam’s developmental delay, unsteadiness, ataxia, nystagmus, and vomiting are signs of neurodegeneration, consistent with Leigh’s disease.\n\n\n\nSlide 6: Instructional Questions (continued)\nQuestion 2:\nWhy is MRI imaging helpful in diagnosing Leigh’s disease?\nAnswer:\nMRI reveals characteristic symmetric lesions in the basal ganglia and brainstem, typical in Leigh’s disease due to mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\n\n\nSlide 7: Instructional Questions (continued)\nQuestion 3:\nWhat is the significance of elevated lactate in Leigh’s disease?\nAnswer:\nElevated lactate suggests mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to anaerobic metabolism and supporting a mitochondrial disease diagnosis.\n\n\n\nSlide 8: Instructional Questions (continued)\nQuestion 4:\nHow does genetic testing aid in diagnosing Leigh’s disease?\nAnswer:\nGenetic testing identifies mitochondrial DNA mutations confirming Leigh’s disease, offering diagnostic clarity and insights on prognosis.\n\n\n\nSlide 9: Instructional Questions (continued)\nQuestion 5:\nWhat management strategies are available for Leigh’s disease?\nAnswer:\nWhile there’s no cure, management includes supportive care, physical therapy, and sometimes supplements like coenzyme Q10 and thiamine.\n\n\n\nSlide 10: Conclusion\nLeigh’s disease diagnosis requires a multi-modal approach: - Neuroimaging, biochemical markers, and genetic analysis are critical. - Management is supportive, focusing on symptom relief and quality of life improvement."
