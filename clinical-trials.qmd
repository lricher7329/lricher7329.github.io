## RECLAIM-TaurineLC

::: {.trial-highlight}

**Taurine Supplementation as a Novel Therapeutic Approach for Neurocognitive Symptoms in Long COVID**

RECLAIM-TaurineLC is a Phase 2/3, randomized, quadruple-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating whether taurine supplementation can improve fatigue and cognitive dysfunction in adults living with Long COVID. This is my primary clinical trial and represents a convergence of my interests in autonomic dysfunction, post-viral syndromes, and rigorous trial methodology.

## Clinical Trials Acceleration

Clinical trials acceleration is a core pillar of my work. I lead two complementary organizations that together form the operational backbone of clinical trials in northern Alberta, and I am driving a strategic initiative to connect them into a provincial engine.

### UACT — University of Alberta Clinical Trials

[University of Alberta Clinical Trials (UACT)](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/health-sciences/research/university-of-alberta-clinical-trials/index.html) coordinates the university's clinical research ecosystem. UACT provides the institutional framework for conducting trials across all ages and therapeutic areas — from pharmaceuticals and digital devices to exercise interventions and continuing care. The Clinical Trials Office (CTO) serves as its operational secretariat.

Key UACT capabilities include:

- State-of-the-art clinical trial facilities and specialized personnel
- Advanced electronic data capture and trial management systems
- Investigator-initiated trial development support for national grant competitions
- The **Indigenous Clinical Trials Unit (ICTU)** — the first of its kind in Canada, empowering Indigenous-led clinical research

### NACTRC — Northern Alberta Clinical Trials and Research Centre

I serve as **Center Director** of [NACTRC](https://nactrc.ca/), a joint venture between the University of Alberta and Alberta Health Services established in 1999. NACTRC provides clinical research administration, operations, and support across the Edmonton Zone.

NACTRC's mandate:

- Develop a comprehensive clinical research administration and support framework for the University of Alberta and AHS Edmonton Zone
- Implement systems to improve the quality, quantity, and efficiency of clinical research
- Expand clinical research support capacity and streamline study startup
- Serve sponsors and investigators across industry and investigator-initiated trials

Together, UACT and NACTRC form an integrated ecosystem: UACT provides institutional strategy and coordination, while NACTRC delivers operational infrastructure and site-level support.

### The Refocus Initiative

Refocus Clinical Trials is the parent strategic initiative driving clinical trials acceleration across Alberta. It connects infrastructure investment, technology platforms, national partnerships, and methodology expertise into a single coherent vision.

Refocus encompasses several interconnected projects:

- **CFI-CTAP** — the primary infrastructure grant vehicle
- **Alberta FAST** — the provincial acceleration framework
- **Metricis** — the analytics platform providing real-time trial metrics
- **Methodology programs** — enrichment designs, adaptive trials, AI-enhanced data strategies

### CFI-CTAP

The **Clinical Trials Acceleration Platform (CFI-CTAP)** is a major Canada Foundation for Innovation infrastructure grant application designed to build the physical and digital infrastructure needed to run clinical trials faster, more efficiently, and at greater scale across Alberta.

CFI-CTAP supports:

- Shared clinical trial infrastructure across Edmonton and Calgary
- Technology platforms for trial operations (Catalyst, Metricis)
- Data integration and analytics capabilities
- Training and capacity-building for clinical trial personnel

### Alberta FAST

**Alberta FAST** (Facilitated Access to Studies and Trials) is a sub-initiative within Refocus aimed at streamlining the pathway from trial concept to patient enrollment. Alberta FAST addresses the operational bottlenecks — contract negotiation, ethics review timelines, site activation — that slow trial startup.

## Trial Methodology

Across all of these initiatives, I maintain an active research program in clinical trial methodology itself:

- **Enrichment trial designs** — using patient selection strategies to improve trial efficiency and reduce sample sizes
- **Adaptive trial methods** — Bayesian and response-adaptive approaches to trial design
- **AI-enhanced trial data** — developing NLP and machine learning tools to improve data quality, site monitoring, and signal detection
- **Diversity in clinical trials** — research on improving equity, diversity, and inclusion in trial recruitment, particularly for Indigenous communities and underrepresented populations

---

## Clinical Trials Funding

I contribute to broader efforts to expand clinical trials funding in Canada:

- **Clinical Trials Funding Expansion Initiative** — strategic initiative to increase federal and provincial investment in clinical trial infrastructure
- **Tri-Agency Success Initiative** — institutional program to improve success rates on Tri-Council grant competitions
- **Kaye Innovation Fund** — letter of intent for the Kaye Edmonton Clinic Research Fund

## Vision

The goal is not more trials. It is better trials — faster to activate, more efficient to run, more representative of the patients they serve, and more impactful in their outcomes. Alberta can be the province that demonstrates how a coordinated, technology-enabled clinical trials ecosystem works.
